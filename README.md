# Networks- A dash application for visualizing information diffusion

This application visualizes the spread of information across a village at different points in time. The data is from the experiment conducted by [Banerjee et al.](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/BCDJ). Multiple individuals in each village were informed of a microfinance product that was being offered by a non-profit organization. The researchers then studied how information about this product spread across time and the number of households that took up the product in each time period.
