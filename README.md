# networks

Implementation of Vill_Net class for visualizing networks from [Banerjee et al.](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/BCDJ) The class has the following methods -

1. init 
2. mf_takeup - adding whether a particular node takes up microfinance or not based on its eigen vector centrality 
3. plot_graph - plotting the network marking the nodes that have taken up microfinance 

To implement-
1. Visualization/animation of take up rates across time periods
2. app.py file to run this as an application
